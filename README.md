# CollisionPoints
Implemented a point quadtree in Java to optimize spatial queries on large 2D point sets. Reduced mouse-click detection and collision checks from brute-force  𝑂 ( 𝑛 ) O(n)/ 𝑂 ( 𝑛 2 ) O(n 2 ) to logarithmic and sublinear time by hierarchically partitioning space into quadrants for efficient point storage and retrieval.
